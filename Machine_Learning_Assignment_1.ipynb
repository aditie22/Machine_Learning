    "A)Artificial Intelligence refers to the simulation of human intelligence processes by machines, particularly computer systems. It involves the development of algorithms and models that enable computers to perform tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as problem-solving, decision-making, natural language understanding, and perception. AI can be categorized into two types: narrow or weak AI, which is designed for a specific task, and general or strong AI, which would have human-like cognitive abilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: Chatbots are a common example of narrow AI. They can engage in natural language conversations and provide information or assistance based on predefined patterns and responses. For instance, a customer support chatbot can interact with users, answer their queries, and guide them through troubleshooting processes.\n",
    "\n",
    "B) Machine Learning (ML):\n",
    "Machine Learning is a subset of AI that focuses on the development of algorithms that allow computers to learn from data. Instead of being explicitly programmed for specific tasks, ML algorithms learn patterns and relationships from data and improve their performance over time through experience. ML can be further categorized into supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning, depending on the nature of the learning process.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: Email filtering is a classic application of machine learning. Imagine an email service that automatically categorizes incoming emails as \"spam\" or \"not spam.\" A supervised machine learning algorithm could be trained on a dataset of labeled emails where each email is tagged as spam or not spam. The algorithm learns to recognize patterns in the email content and headers that indicate whether an email is likely to be spam or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "C) Deep Learning:\n",
    "Deep Learning is a specialized subfield of machine learning that focuses on neural networks with many layers (deep neural networks). These deep neural networks are capable of automatically learning intricate features and representations from large amounts of data. Deep learning has achieved remarkable success in various tasks such as image and speech recognition, natural language processing, and game playing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: Image recognition using deep learning is a prominent application. Consider an image recognition system that can identify objects in photographs. A deep neural network can be trained on a massive dataset of labeled images, where each image is associated with the objects it contains. The network learns to recognize complex features and patterns in images, enabling it to accurately identify objects in new, unseen images.\n"

    "Unsupervised learning is a type of machine learning where the algorithm is tasked with finding patterns, structures, or relationships in a dataset without the presence of labeled outputs.
